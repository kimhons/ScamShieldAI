- Infrastructure designed to hide true location and ownership

**Technical Red Flags:**
- **Tor Exit Nodes**: Traffic routing through The Onion Router network
- **VPN Chains**: Multiple layers of VPN services to hide origin
- **Proxy Cascades**: Traffic bouncing through multiple proxy servers
- **CDN Abuse**: Misusing Content Delivery Networks to hide real servers

**Network Anomalies Detected:**
- **Asymmetric Routing**: Inbound and outbound traffic taking different paths
- **Geographically Impossible Routes**: Traffic patterns that defy geography
- **High Latency Patterns**: Delays consistent with traffic obfuscation
- **Port Scanning Activity**: Evidence of reconnaissance or attack preparation

**Security Implications:**
- **Attribution Difficulty**: Hard to trace back to real operators
- **Evasion Capability**: Can quickly change infrastructure when detected
- **Operational Security**: Sophisticated understanding of network security
- **Professional Operation**: Indicates organized cybercrime group

### 5. üí∞ **Financial Irregularities Detected**
**Severity**: CRITICAL ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è  
**Agent**: Financial Intelligence Specialist, CIA Intelligence Analyst  
**Confidence**: 91%

**What This Means:**
- Financial transactions or patterns associated with the target show suspicious characteristics
- Money movement patterns consistent with money laundering or fraud
- Connections to known financial crime networks or suspicious accounts

**Financial Red Flags:**
- **Structuring**: Breaking large transactions into smaller amounts to avoid reporting
- **Rapid Movement**: Money moving quickly through multiple accounts
- **Shell Companies**: Transactions involving companies with no real business purpose
- **High-Risk Banks**: Using banks known for poor AML (Anti-Money Laundering) controls

**Suspicious Transaction Patterns:**
- **Round Numbers**: Transactions in exact amounts (e.g., $10,000, $50,000)
- **Just-Under Reporting**: Amounts just below regulatory reporting thresholds
- **Frequent Small Amounts**: Many small transactions instead of fewer large ones
- **Cross-Border Flows**: Money moving between multiple countries rapidly

**Money Laundering Indicators:**
