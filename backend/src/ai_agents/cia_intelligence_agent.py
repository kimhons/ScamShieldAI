           - Tactical recommendations and options
           - Policy implications and considerations
           - Operational recommendations
           - Resource allocation guidance
           - Risk assessment and mitigation
        
        5. **Predictive Analysis and Forecasting**
           Develop predictive assessments:
           - Future threat trajectory analysis
           - Capability development forecasting
           - Operational pattern projection
           - Scenario probability assessment
           - Timeline and milestone prediction
           - Contingency planning requirements
        
        CIA ANALYTICAL STANDARDS:
        - Distinguish between facts and assessments
        - Express confidence levels clearly
        - Consider alternative explanations
        - Identify key assumptions
        - Provide actionable intelligence
        - Maintain analytical objectivity
        
        CONFIDENCE LEVELS:
        - High Confidence: Strong evidence with minimal uncertainty
        - Medium Confidence: Reasonable evidence with some uncertainty  
        - Low Confidence: Limited evidence with significant uncertainty
